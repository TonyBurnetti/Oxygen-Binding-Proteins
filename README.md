# Oxygen-Binding-Proteins
Raw data for studying the fitness effects of oxygen binding protein expressin in snowflake yeast.

The Julia 1.8.2 model used for simulating facilitated diffusion of oxygen via myoglobin is found in Myoglobin_Diffusion_Model.zip. This contains a Jupyter notebook, Manifest file, and Project file necessary to run the simulation.

The results of this Julia model and its analysis can be found in Simulation_Data.zip.

The data and analysis of MitoLoc mitochondrial membrane potential data can be found in MitoLoc.zip.

The data and analysis of snowflakes, small snowflakes, and unicells grown in glycerol under low and high oxygen conditions can be found in Size_and_Oxygen_comparison.zip.

The data and analysis of induced myoglobin expression in snowflake yeast can be found in Induced_Expression.zip.

Supplementary data can be found in Supplementary_Data.zip.
